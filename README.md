# 🧠 React Practice Projects – Nandan Hegde

A collection of mini-projects built while learning and practicing **React.js**. These projects explore key React concepts such as state, props, hooks, conditional rendering, component composition, routing, and more. Great for refreshing fundamentals and experimenting with React features.

## 🚀 What's Inside

Each folder contains an individual project focused on a specific concept or use case.

### ✅ Sample Projects You Might Find:
- **Birthday Reminder App** – basic state manipulation and list rendering

- **Menu Filter App** – filtering lists based on categories
- **Grocery Bud** – full CRUD with local storage
- **Navbar with React Router** – basic SPA routing setup
- **Stripe Menu** – advanced layout and dropdown logic

```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) depending on the tooling.

## 📌 Notes

- All projects use **functional components** and **React Hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
- Great for interview prep and hands-on reinforcement of core concepts.
- Feel free to reuse components in your real-world projects.
